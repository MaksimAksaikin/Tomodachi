# Welcoming message

Hello, my friends! 

Let's test what you've learned.

## To-do

* First, **fork** this repo.

* Then, clone it to your local workstation.

* Then create and switch to a new branch.

* Then make some notes. For example I've created some titles and you can add a descriptions and some labels that used with the commands, for example "git commit -m".

Feel free to play around with markdown too, try to add pictures or gifs to make this doc as userfull as we can.

Good luck and enjoy! :)

# Git commands

Here we'll take a look at the most basic command used in Git.

### Git init

### Git add

### Git commit

### Git checkout

This is important command, yet I don7t know much about it. Usially we use *git checkout* to switch from one branch to another (the full command is: *__git checkout <branch_name>__*). I've read that there is an experimental switch command to do the same, but never saw that in practice.

Also I usually use label **-b** with this command to create and switch to a new branch like that *__git checkout -b <branch_name>__*. For now, I find it faster and convenient, that using two separete commands, *git branch* and then *git checkout*.

### Git merge
